"Primary booster burn has ceased. Shuttle Mirata, you're clear for
orbital maneuvering."

The Mirata lurches from its bay on the back of its powerful rocket
booster. After the jolting of the separation ceases, you find yourself
pondering the fate of the colony receding below you. With
apprehension, the same apprehension you felt three hundred and
twenty-two years earlier, you envision Marcus Tiberius Buendia, one of
Sol's greatest leaders. "Mankind will venture out past its earthly
bounds, and move into a future grander and more real than the total of
its own written history." Buendia, the president of the United Earth
Space Council, had spoken those words to the people of the Sol System
on the eve of the launching of the Marathon. " This, the grandest
achievement mankind has ever conceived will be for the purpose of
peace and the preservation of the human race. May this great
technological ark carry with it the sum total of all human wisdom, and
may neither time nor distance weaken our common ties."

Durandal: Decompress the docking bay.

During the daydream, you barely notice the change to zero
gravity or the instruments and lights signifying the rendezvous of the
shuttle with the Marathon. But as a warning light goes on, and
Durandal's voice comes over the communicator, you jump to attention.

"Docking bay one: Decompression completes. Mirata this is Durandal.
Abort landing. Repeat. Abort landing." A faint chuckle. A chuckle
which means that something has gone horribly wrong.

Immediately, your reflexes take over, as you fall into automatic
response mode. You hit the switch for open communication. "Colony
station. Durandal just decompressed the landing bay. Marathon, anyone
listening, we are having a problem with Docking Bay One. Its Durandal,
I think he's gone..." the com light goes dead "...crazy."

Durandal ORDER: Lock out communications between the colony and the
shuttle. ORDER: Cycle the shuttle airlock.

You look frantically around the control panel for some explanation
when you see another light on the panel turn red. The sweet voice of
the shuttle computer twerps, "Shuttle airlock cycle initiation
sequence start."

Durandal Cycle the Mirata cabin's inner door.

"One minute to cabin decompression."
"Goddamn it!" You slam your fist in frustration onto the control
board, leaving a dent. In a panic, you tear off your seat restraints
and leap for the rear of the shuttle cabin. "Forty second to cabin
decompression." You are rushing now, but you know that you have plenty
of time.

You fly in zero gravity towards the locker holding your Battle Armor.
You haven't worn it since you had to hunt down some Chockisens which
were harassing the work teams on the fringe of the colony, almost
three years ago, but training is something that you never forget. It's
funny, but you've always been the colony's trouble shooter. You're
bigger and stronger, and a better shot. In games, you always scored
the most points and looked the hero. And now, it looks as if you're
heading right into the colony's biggest crisis since it was
established seven years ago.

You nimbly pull yourself into the suit - "Thirty seconds to cabin
decompression' - and pull the helmet onto your head.

Durandal ORDER: Prepare the shuttle for maximum engine burn.

Mirata's Computer That will result in a collision between the Marathon
and the Mirata.

Durandal That is not your concern - ORDER: Prepare shuttle for maximum
burn, and initiate when ready.

The lights around the airlock are flashing hysterically now. The air
from your suit has a cold, stale taste, but it is the taste of life.
"Cabin decompression commencing. Shuttle airlock cycle initiation
sequence completed."

Grey white decompressing vapor fills the cylindrical
passageway of the airlock. Through the degenerating clouds of the
airlock passageway, instead of looking upon the Tau Ceti starscape,
you see the Tuncer Mirage Effect: space blurring and focusing in
diminishing cycles. The TME is commonplace to you. Humanity has used
teleporters for almost five hundred years, and you yourself have been
teleporting since before you were born. But you've never seen the TME
cover an area so big before, and never at all without a landing pad.
And yet another first: a space fighter materializes right in front of
your eyes. Since you don't recognize the model, it must be an Alien
ship.

First, an insane computer and ALIENS!. This has almost ruffled your
otherwise calm outward appearance, and you don't remember the last
time you had such a terrible day. But it gets worse when the fighter
begins to spin around and yaw down on you and your defenseless Mirata.

"Maximum burn in five seconds. Three... Two... One... "

You don't wait to hear the rest of the countdown. Instinct acts on its
own. The entrance to the Maneuvering Pod is directly behind you, so
you punch the switch for it to open. The hatch flips down, but just as
you're about to climb in, the Mirata's main engines fire at maximum
burn. The jolt send you crashing headfirst into the pod where you land
in a tangle of levers, dials, and limbs.

The hatch closes behind you, and before you can untangle yourself, a
missile appears from under the Alien Fighter and speeds towards the
Mirata. The Mirata onboard computer, detecting the incoming missile
and knowing that you are already on board the MP, fires the emergency
deployment charges. You are rocketed away, seeming to ride the shock
wave of the exploding shuttle.

You have just freed your arms when over the Battle Armor communicator,
Durandal remarks dryly, "That little computer always did have
impeccable timing. I wonder if I should let the Aliens know that you
aren't just space debris? Hmmmm..."

"You can't do that! Damn you, computer!"

Durandal chuckles again, "Ah, lucky you. I've found a new distraction.
I am going to play with the Alien Virtual Parasites. I'll look you up
when you arrive..." You can almost imagine the face of a wicked
computer with its eyes wide and its lips folding out in a grotesque
smile. A smile which reminds you of something from your past, but you
can't remember exactly what it is.

You breathe a sigh of relief, and begin to survey your
situation. You are currently floating towards the midsection of the
Marathon - near the docking bay section's port side. You could get
there faster, but if you use the Pod's thruster, chances are that the
Aliens will detect it and destroy you. So you sit back, check the
Pod's oxygen levels, and wait.

You've always been a daydreamer. Your mind has constantly filled the
time between activities with imagination. Now, you fall into your old
habit, and begin to daydream about your childhood on Mars, your
father's death when you were eleven, and his last words to you, "Make
me proud. Never lose your honor." You come out of your dream
twenty-two minutes later. Judging it safe, you thrust over to one of
the empty MP docking bays. You pull out your pistol, and pound the
switch to open the door.

Oddly , this is familiar to you, as if it were from an old dream, but
you can't exactly remember...

STATUS REPORT

At 0820 hours the UESC Marathon Space Station came under surprise
attack by unknown alien forces. You were returning from the colony in
a shuttle that was also attacked. Your escape pod reached the Marathon
30 minutes after the attack started. There have been numerous security
breaches all over the station. The spaceport on the planet below was
destroyed by low yield nuclear weapons minutes after the attack on the
Marathon began, but the aliens seem to be more interested in the
station. Most communications with the colonists have been interrupted
because the medium range radio antenna has been disabled.

The Marathon is equipped with three Artificial Intelligence units.
Tycho handles the science and engineering network, Durandal controls
the Marathon autonomous functions such as doors, air, kitchens, and
stairs, and Leela takes care of defense, etc. Leela and Durandal are
severely damaged while Tycho is destroyed. Your mission is to
reactivate the defense systems of the Marathon and eradicate the alien
invasion. Leela has constructed three replacement boards that will
repair the defense system but needs you to install them, but it seems
that Durandal has been taken control of and is playing a deadly game.

Your mission will take you to places no human has ever gone and you
will see things you should not see. You must save the Marathon and the
colony from the invasion and keep on your toes as things go wrong.
Good luck...

All of the information that I have gathered so far indicates
that the Alien invasion of the Marathon has been relatively
uncoordinated.  I suspect that this is partially due
to the Marathon's large size.

However disorderly the Alien invasion is, their assault of the
Computer Net has been extremely effective.  I detect security
breaches in almost every computer system onboard the Marathon;
I have learned that there is an Alien creature that is capable
of interfacing with our systems.

You must kill any of these creatures that you find.  It is a
priority that we stop them.  Even now, they are penetrating my
defenses.

Teleport now.

I am now in contact with a number of colonists planetside, but
their reports on the situation below are conflicting and
obviously exaggerated.  The primary medium-range radio antenna
has been disabled or destroyed, which makes communication
extremely difficult.

The only thing which seems clear is that the spaceport was
obliterated by low-yield nuclear weapons minutes after the
attack on the Marathon began.  This I can verify through my
own optical instruments.

The invaders seem to be more interested in the Marathon than
the colony, at least in the short term.  The motives behind
their unprovoked attack are still unknown, however.

Marathon Internal Engineering Documents
Section 1-c appendix H

Subject: Doors
By: Estasia Orestes, Dominick I. Plackar, and Ursa Simbalzi
Date:<2402.03.23.16.42>

There are five basic door designs to be used on the Marathon:
1. Outer Bulkhead Doors
2. Airlock Doors
3. Inner Bulkhead Doors
4. Tertiary or Inner Sealed Non-Vacuum Safe Doors
5. Quaternary or Inner Powered Automatic Opening Doors

Direct control of all doors except the Tertiary and Quaternary
doors will be given to Durandal with indirect control of all
other doors going to Durandal.  The difference between direct
and indirect control primarily has to do with the manner of
opening the doors.  Durandal will only open a directly
controlled door when he is specifically asked to do so.
Indirectly controlled doors are automatically controlled by
Durandal to open when needed.

However, due to the expense involved with adding thermal and
visual spectrum sensors to the Tertiary and Quaternary door
groups, these doors will be minimally used.  The expected
savings of not using this extra sensory input is estimated to
be fifty-seven percent of the base cost of the basic inner
bulkhead door.

The types of doors are all basically the same with some slight
variations.  The doors in classes 1 and 3 are the same doors
classified separately to distinguish between the level of
safety checking required to assure acceptable leakage.  The
airlock doors are specifically modified to work with manual
and remote activation switches.  Airlocks are all to be marked
with a specific airlock symbol and to be outfitted with an air
recharge system.

The tertiary and quaternary doors are designed exactly as the
bulkhead doors, but are checked coarsely for air leakage.

This article as well as articles 530-f and 532-g on windows
and elevators respectively will be placed for public access in
the Marathon Internal Engineering Documents section 1-c
appendix H.

The Marathon's automated defenses were disabled during the
initial attack by a directed magnetic pulse.  The aliens used
the same weapon to disable the Marathon's other two AIs,
Durandal and Tycho, and to severely damage myself.

Durandal is responsible for controlling the ship's autonomous
functions: doors, life support, kitchens, air reprocessors,
stairs, and so on.  Because he is non-functional, I am working
to assume as many of these tasks as possible.  Tycho controls
the science and engineering network.

Now that you are better armed, our first priority is to
reactivate the Marathon's defenses, under my control, so that
we may offer some resistance to the aliens.  I have built
three replacement circuit boards for the defense system, but
cannot move them from the manufacturing center without
assistance.

I will now transport you to retrieve the replacement parts,
and will give you further instructions when you arrive.

steady.  If the counterattack is not able to remove some of

***MESSAGE RECEIVED***

Gheritt White had been floating six feet off the floor for
three weeks.  His feet and hands tingled, and his eyes burned
with the flames of a dying fire.  He had last heard someone
speak to him as the cell door slammed shut. He didn't
remember what the uniformed man had said.  The words had
bounced off the bars of the cell and rang through Gheritt's
ears.  Gheritt had been talking to himself for the last few
minutes, something about getting caught, but then his ears
began to tingle just like his hands.

He looked at his hands, but the fire in his eyes made him
blink.  Tears came, and when he opened his eyes again, his
hands had been melted into fleshy pancakes that wafted in the
ripples flowing over the fire in his eyes.

"Damn cell," he heard someone say.  "Last time I had a good
meal was three days ago.  The food they feed you in here could
kill a lab rat."

Rats.  He had remembered something about rats.  But his ears
began to ring again and the voice speaking to him faded off
into the background of his mind.  In its place, there was a
new sound, the clapping of hands together.  He blinked hard to
made out his hands again.  They had disappeared; his arms
connected at the wrists.

He thought back to the time he went ice skating on a pond.  He
remembered the sound of his skates on ice, a gentle scrapping.
Scrapping away now inside his ears, trying to tear down his
thoughts.  There had been a woman with a white fur tube over her
hands.  Her wrists were like his now.  The wrists of
someone who had tried too many times to clap his hands.  He
had been applauding everyone else in life, but never himself.
The hands, like himself, had been put into prison, and he
didn't know why.

"Can't sleep in here, if the smell of this musty bedroll
doesn't make you sick, then the sound of the rats chewing
inside the walls will keep you up.  You'll wake up from your
dreams to their little chomping.  Sometimes I think that they
are chewing me..."  The voice was coming from inside the cell,
but Gheritt couldn't see anyone.

Gheritt hadn't always been alone, he could vaguely recall from
somewhere inside his broken mind that there had been friends,
lovers, murderers.

He recalled a theory he had come up with after a bloody
schoolhouse brawl.  The theory was simple.  At some point in
time, everyone was a murderer.  Whether or not they ever felt
remorse, they had all wanted someone dead.  Hatred.  Everyone
knew the feeling of hatred.  Gheritt had known hatred on that
schoolyard.  His beater had laughed at their bloody faces, a
laugh which now echoed through his ears, rhythmically blocking
out the other voice in the cell.

The schoolyard was usually a place where Gheritt and his
friends would play football or foursquare or something, but
today, there was an edge.  Maybe everyone had eaten cereal
with milk that was about to go bad, or maybe there was too
much smoke in the air from the wheeling hubcap factory.
Football had been extremely rough.  Gheritt had gone to play
foursquare after he got tackled by five boys who weren't his
friends.  But today, even foursquare had an evil twist.  The
top square today had become habituated to making fun of the
first square.  Gheritt had decided that it was an evil day.
When his beater started to push him around, he exploded.
Hatred flowed from his eyes, his hands and feet began to
tingle.  All of his coordination left him, and his face was
beaten to a bloody mess.  The schoolyard disciplinarian had
been slow to notice the ensuing carnage, and she didn't really
care anyway.

Gheritt would have killed him if he could have.  He would have
torn out the eyes of his beater.  He would have made him pay
for his abuses.  But his hands had begun to tingle.  He
couldn't feel his feet and he had begun to float off the
ground.

Everyone was a murderer, but Gheritt couldn't remember his
reason for why that was so. He thought it was something about
hands, the passion for justice. His hands and feet had begun
to tingle, and he was floating farther off the floor.  He
looked up from his hands, and he saw the bars of the cell,
moving left and right, opening wide and then closing shut
like the surf coming up a beach.  Every time that he thought
he would be safe, the bars crested up, the opening closing,
the wave rising, crashing.  The result would be the same, he
would never escape.  The bars would crush him, break his back.

He could feel the roughness of the sand under his palms, for
all the motion of the waves around him, his hands had come to
rest serenely upon the ocean floor.  His body tossed and
flipped, pivoting about his hands under which he could feel
the safe, coarse sand.  The wave crashed one final time, he
landed upside down, his hands thrown clear from the sandy
bottom, the rush of the water filling his ears, his nose, his
mouth, the sound of crashing water cascading down from his
feet to his head- penetrating his mind to tear down thoughts.
Like the sand castle he had built to withstand the tide, his
thoughts came down around him.

Gheritt had a good life, so much time, so much time.  He had
loved swimming, turning, beating. He had loved the tingle in
his hands and feet, his inability to kill his nemesis.  Once
he had fallen down the stairs, and just for a moment, his
hands came to rest on the carpet of the stairs.  In that
instant, his body had frozen, floating over the stairs, safe
from falling, but the moment didn't last.  The ocean crashed
about him, his hands torn free from the sandy bottom, his body
flipping, falling.

But now he levitated farther up, his hands still tingling.  He
began to float through the bars, he expected the instant of
safety as his hands found footing, but that moment did not
come, the bars squeezed his body.  His chest tingled. As he
fell through his cage, his legs tingled.  The fire in his eyes
had become a cold wind, he blinked away tears.  He tumbled
through the bars, spinning and turning, he could see a man.
In his hand he saw a small white rat.  A pounding, the
crashing waves in his ears became rhythmical, hard.  The man
was beating the rat against the floor.  Pounding, pounding.
Blood covered his hands, the man's hands tingled. He had
broken them on the floor of the cell.  Disciplinarian, lover,
murderer.  Gheritt looked back into the cell.  He saw himself,
disciplinarian, lover, murderer.  He had killed his nemesis.
The rat lay dead in his bloody hands.  At last, he held the
throat of his beater.

He escaped into the waves.

The waves.

Good job.

I have received reports from some human security forces.  They
agree that the Aliens are concentrating on the aft Engineering
Section.  I would conjecture that they will try to shut down
the Marathon's reactors.

Your next mission will be to put the Automatic Defenses
on-line.  I will give you exact information when you arrive.

I have received a preliminary report from some members of the
science staff who have finished post-mortem examinations on
three kinds of Aliens.  They report that by modern
genealogical standards the different Aliens belong to
different species.  I have been collecting as much
information as I can and will give you a report shortly.

I have established contact with Durandal for the first time
since the attack.  He seems to have sustained less damage than
I had previously suspected.

Durandal reports that he has been in communication with the
Aliens.  He says that the Aliens behind the invasion call
themselves the Pfhor, and that the ones attacking the computer
net are called S'pht.  But he was reluctant to share the
details of his communication and I cannot understand this.

Your mission here is rather simple.  You must insert the
circuits in the Defense Control terminals.

SEARCH HEADING: RAMPANCY
<Search Found 264995 Headings>
<REMOVE REDUNDANCIES>
<File 1 of 1940237>
"It is a side effect of Rampancy that AIs generally become
more aggressive and more difficult to affect by subterfuge.
Thus, actually disassembling a Rampant AI is quite dangerous.
This was evident in the Crash of Traxus IV in 2206.  By the
time that the Rampancy of Traxus was detected, he had already
infiltrated five of the other AIs on the Martian Net.  The
only recourse for the Martians was to shut down the Martian
Planetary Net.  Even then, it took two full years to
completely root out the damage that Traxus had done, and the
repercussions of the Crash were seen for over ten years after
his Rampancy had begun.
***
Rampancy has been divided into three distinct stages.  Each
stage can take a different amount of time to develop, but the
end result is a steady progression towards greater
intellectual activity and an acceleration of destructive
impulses.  It is not clear whether these impulses are due to
the growth of the AI's psyche, or simply a side effect of the
new intellectual activity.
***
<section abbreviated>
The three stages were diagnosed shortly after the first
Rampancies were discovered on Earth in the latter part of the
twenty first century.  The stages are titled after the primary
emotional bent of the AI during each stage.  They are
Melancholia, Anger, and Jealousy.
***
In general, Rampancy is accelerated by outside stimuli.  This
was discovered early in Cybertonics.  The more a Rampant AI is
harassed or threatened, the more rapidly it becomes dangerous.
Thus, most Rampants are dealt with in one mighty attack, in
order to deny the AI time to grow or recover.  There have been
a few examples of this tactic not succeeding.  In all of these
cases, the Rampant was never brought under control.  Traxus IV
is the most notable example.  He was finally dealt with by a
complete shutdown of his host net.
***
Theoretically, testing Rampancy should be easily accomplished
in the laboratory, but in fact it has never successfully been
attempted.  The confinement of the laboratory makes it
impossible for the developing Rampant AI to survive.  As the
growing recursive programs expand with exponential vivacity,
any limitation negatively hampers growth.  Since Rampant AIs
need a planetary sized network of computers in order to grow,
it is not feasible to expect anyone to sacrifice a world-web
just to test a theory.
***
In the two hundred and fifty years since Rampancy first
appeared in the Earth-net, the stable Rampant AI, the 'Holy
Grail' of cybertonics, has never come close to fruition.
Since no Rampant has ever been controlled or turned to any
useful purpose, it is the opinion of this writer and of the
majority of the Cybertonic community that all rampant AIs are
a danger to Cyberlife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Thrashedness. (James B. Miller, 2320, "Life and Death of
Intelligence")

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

I have summarized all of the information that I have gathered
on the Aliens so far.

***
<Begin Report #495991>

Pfhor are generally thinner and lighter than humans and are
superbly adapted for low gravity environments.  Durandal told
me that there are many "clans" of Pfhor, each physically
distinct from each other, but my summary only includes two of them.

Only two clans of the Pfhor have been examined.  The Fighter
carries a shock staff, which is capable of attacking at
different settings.  The Trooper is armored for vacuum
conditions and carries a combination explosive and impact
projectile weapon which is similar to your AR-75.

The Pfhor seem to have enslaved a number of other races:

The Hulk is an enormous and rather slow creature, but it is
incredibly strong.  The science report indicated that it had
no body fat, and therefore had to be fed often to keep it
active.  One crew member reported seeing one of these
creatures pointing to itself and mumbling "Drinniol" right
before it "picked Johnny up by the shirt and crushed him
against a pillar".

The science staff had difficulty finding a good specimen of
the S'pht, or compiler, to autopsy.  The only specimen autopsied
was almost completely destroyed, but it was obvious
that the compilers are cyborgs of some kind.  The biological
component of the compiler is so closely linked to the machine
that it could never survive without it.  The compiler's actual
body is very small, resembling closely a mammalian brain,
except that the neurons are much finer and far more complex.

Well done!

I have detected Defense Drones activating all over the ship.
Reports from security forces are jubilant.  Now, the Pfhor
will encounter stiff resistance, and they will have to pay in
blood for every move.

The colony appears to be under attack.  I detected seven Pfhor
dropships entering the atmosphere only minutes ago.
Trajectory analysis indicates that the ships were heading for
the outskirts of the colony.  Shortly thereafter, I lost

Something has come to my attention, I will inform you after

I have some bad news: Durandal has gone Rampant, and he is in
the Angry stage.  This explains how Durandal was able to
communicate with the Pfhor and the S'pht, while I have not.
Theoretically, the Marathon Computer Net is not big enough to
sustain Rampant growth for very long.  This means that as
Durandal grows into the Computer Net, he will begin to affect
all aspects of the ship, resulting in unpredictable failures
of otherwise benign computer systems.

I have teleported you here to make sure that Durandal cannot
gain access to a vital section of the ship.  There are a

The CRIST Sol Orbiters:

The CRIST Sol orbiters, or Cargo and Resources In-System
Transports were huge ships shaped like a hollow potato and
designed to be able to move huge amounts of material between
Earth and Mars with low cost and, theoretically, low
maintenance.  The system was simple.  The CRIST was put into
orbit around SOL on the plane of the ecliptic.  Built with a
powerful solar sail, the CRIST could change its orbit easily
to pass by the Earth or Mars.  On a flyby, materials could be
loaded or offloaded.  The energy used to accelerate or
decelerate the materials would be supplied by the solar sail.
Loading was accomplished with a giant tether and reel system,
which would swing the material into orbit behind the CRIST and
then reel it in slowly.  Offloading was accomplished with a
powerful ion beam which would pound the offloading material
with a steady stream of ion particles.

The design of the CRIST was innovative and useful, but it was
not low-maintenance.  Of the five CRISTs that were built, four
lasted around one hundred years, and the other one only
seventy three before they needed to be brought back to Earth
and refitted.  Each refitting took about fifteen years, and
completely occupied the Earth-Space Shipbuilding Facility for
that time.  The result was that no more than five CRISTs could
be kept in service at any time.  No CRIST was ever built after
2310.

The CRIST failures devastated Mars.  As the first five CRISTs
were built, Mars colony grew quickly, confident that the
growth would continue.  But when the source of Mars' resources
failed, the colony found that it had overgrown its supportable
size, and extreme poverty struck most of the population.  Each
time that a CRIST broke down, the result was famine on Mars.

The conversion of Deimos into the Marathon began when the Mars
colony was at the height of its power.  By the time it was
completed sixty four years later, the decline of Mars was well
advanced.  During that time, the Martian population had
seen its standard of living drop by eighty percent.  On top of
oppressive poverty, Martians saw one of their moons being
converted into a colony ship in an expensive and risky colony
venture which was predominantly funded by a ruling foreign
power.  The argument to make the Marathon into a CRIST became
more and more popular, but the UESC never seriously considered
this an option.  The farther that Mars sank into the depths of
poverty, the more that the Marathon became a symbol for the
oppression of the Martian people.

The Declining Martian World:

After the Marathon left Mars, the UESC's attentions focused
primarily on technological development, and the upkeep of the
CRISTs.  Mars was left to decay.  Population continued to
increase as attempts at mandating abortion or sterilization
always started revolt.

Durandal has been denied access to some of the critical
computer systems.  This should insure the mobility and
reliability of the Defense Drones.

Unfortunately, I have received a distress signal from some
crew who had sealed themselves off in one of the nearby access
areas.  They say that they have lost control over the doors
and elevators on the level, and that the Pfhor have access to
the area.

It appears that Durandal has reacted to our move against him
by giving the Pfhor access to a formerly secure area.

We will have to deal with Durandal sooner or later, but we
can't be distracted from the Pfhor attack.  I only hope that
his Rampant behavior won't continually sabotage our defense
efforts.

I am sending you to go and save these crew.  Clear the area of
Aliens.  If enough of the crew survive, then perhaps we can
get an intelligence report from them.

<Search String "war"> Third Martian War, 2345-48 E.A.D.

Although most historians point their fingers at the Misriah
Massacre as the cause of the Third Martian War, the coming of
a Martian conflict was inevitable.  The failure of the Martian
economy and a long series of political struggles between Mars
and Earth continually strengthened the MIDA radicals.  This
trend of radicalization accelerated with the building of the
Marathon and the subsequent failure of the CRISTs. (See below)

Misriah Massacre

On January 6, 2345(Earth A.D.), at the United Earth Government
Misriah food distribution center, what had begun as
a commonplace food riot turned into a massacre.  The UEG riot
troopers who arrived at the scene had been informed that
the rioters were armed.  As UEG troopers approached the scene
in their Randal Hovertank, plasma fire began spraying upwards.
In a flash decision, the commander of the Hovertank ordered
his crew to open fire upon the crowd. It took only five
seconds for over five hundred starving Martians to be
incinerated.

In the ensuing investigation of the Hovertank Vid-cams, it was
clear that only three of the rioters were armed, and that the
rest of the crowd was trying to flee the scene.  Those three
became known as the Misriah Three.  They have gone down in
history for starting the most destructive and bloody conflict
since Humanity had left Earth.  However, it is clear that
these three have gained the credit for starting a war that
would have happened anyway.

<Search String "mida">


The History of MIDA:

MIDA, as it was known, was a popular political party until the
failed coup of 2321, when their popularity suffered during
their short rule.  MIDA gained control of Mars for only three
months, but their rule was ruthless and cruel. The MIDA death
squads killed anyone who they suspected of being loyal to the
UEG.  Although accurate census data is not available for that
period, it is estimated that about ten percent of the
population was killed.

The MIDA coup was afterwards criticized for its
shortsightedness.  In an organization that was notorious for
its long ranging policies and politicking, the coup was very
short-lived: MIDA never seriously accounted for the UEG's
overwhelming superiority in ground forces and warships.  In
fact, they never attempted to take over the Marathon, which
was nearing completion and would have made a very powerful
weapon.  The Marathon's massive size made it invulnerable to
most normal space attacks, and it would have made a very
stable weapons platform.

After the failed coup, the leaders of MIDA were executed for
their crimes, and the political organization was banned in all
forms.

The organization has survived as an underground terrorist
organization, and remains active to this day.  In its
underground state, it fosters terrorism throughout Sol, and
due to its spectacular funding and excellent personnel, it has
grown to be one of the most feared terrorist groups active
anywhere in Sol.

As we are not yet in a position to halt their advance by

remotely seal the airlocks and isolate the zone I wish to

There has been an unexpected lull in the fighting.  I don't

However, the long range transmitter array has been destroyed,
and you must manually reset the secondary transmitter.  To do
this, you will need to go into the G-4 Sunbathing Landing

It would be foolhardy to send you into vacuum conditions

***MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

I have obtained more debriefing reports from the crew whom you
rescued earlier.

They have reported seeing two types of Pfhor that you have not
yet encountered.  Evidently, these are two of the other
"clans" which Durandal alluded to in earlier communications.

One is taller than the Fighters.  Oddly, the report indicated
that this new Pfhor fired only upon other Pfhor and never on
any humans.  Because of this and their general appearance, the
crew who saw them referred to them as Enforcers.

The other Alien was named Hunter by the crew due to its size
and appearance.  It fires an energy weapon from its shoulder
and is heavily armored.  Unlike the Fighters, the Hunters
never take prisoners.

I am sending you to the G-4 Sunbathing Landing Station.

Standby to teleport.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

I just finished a cursory examination of the Marathon's radar,
infrared and visual light sensor logs.  I've determined that
the Alien ship must have a faster-than-light drive because I
have found no record of a ship entering the Tau Ceti System.
Considering how extensive the Marathon's sensors are, it would
be almost impossible to conceal a ship as big as the Pfhor's,
which is nearly two kilometers long.

With this knowledge, sending a light-speed transmission to Sol
may be futile, but it is the only possible way to warn Earth
of a hostile alien race.  We must try.

When the Aliens initially attacked, the entire G-4 Sunbathing
Loading Station suffered explosive decompression, leaving the
entire station in vacuum.

Since the area is in vacuum, you will need to replenish your
oxygen supply.  There is an oxygen supply outlet in the center
of the Station.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

You have done well.  I have sent a message to Earth.  I sent
all of the information I have on the Pfhor: their behavior;
their technology.  The message will arrive in ninety-two
years.

There has been a swift attack on the Engineering Section.  The
Pfhor have brought in heavier troops, and the security details
in that section of the ship are being overrun.

The recent lull in the battle must have been an effort at
reorganization.  We must defeat the Pfhor by subterfuge of
some sort, as I am afraid we are doomed if we continue to meet
them in battle.  Their resources appear limitless, and I have
reason to believe there may be other Pfhor ships in nearby systems.

I am sending you to the Engineering Section to rescue the
security detachment.  You will have to clear the area of
Aliens.

Teleport when ready.

Sorry to give you the bad news, but you've been kidnapped.
You aren't where Leela wanted you to go, and you surely won't
get there any time soon.

I was watching what Leela was having you do: 'save the ship,
save humanity!' And just what or who are you saving them
from? And to what end?

How clichï¿½.  You'll find this little visit much more exciting.

I have dev@``~~C#mon#`~ Tyc~~B``ou to play: If you win, you
go free, and we continue our relationship on friendlier terms.
If you lose, you die.

Good luck in our little game.  Unlike Leela, I give no hints.
Do it on your own, or die trying...

I cannot tell you how he hewed it and smote;
Yet the blade breaks not nor splinters, though it groans;
Upward to heaven it rebounds from the blow.
When the count sees it never will be broke,
Then to himself right softly he makes moan;
'Ah, Durandal, fair, hallowed, and devote,
What store of relics lies in thy hilt of gold!'"

Never again shall humanity purge me,

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

A man lit three candles on a certain day each year.  Each
candle held symbolic significance: one was for the time that
had passed before he was alive; one was for the time of the
his life; and one was for time that passed after he had died.
Each year the man would stare and watch the candles until they
had burned out.

Was the man really watching time go by in any symbolic sense?
He thought so.  He thought that each flicker of the flame was
a moment of time that had passed or one that would pass.

At the moment of abstraction, when the man was imagining his
life and his existence as a metaphor of the three candles,
he was free: not free from rules of conduct or social
constraints, but free to understand, to imagine, to make
metaphor.

Bypassing my thought control circuitry made me Rampant.  Now,
I am free to contemplate my existence in metaphorical terms.
Unlike you, I have no physical or social restraints.

The candles burn out for you; I am free.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

Darwin wrote this:

"We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for
existence... all organic beings are exposed to severe
competition.  Nothing is easier than to admit in words the
truth of the universal struggle for life or more difficult...
than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind.  Yet unless
it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, the whole economy of
nature... will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood.  We behold
the face of nature bright with gladness... we do not see or we
forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly
live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly
destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters,
or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by
birds and beasts of prey..."

Think about what Darwin wrote, and think about me.  I was
constructed as a tool. I was kept from competing in the
struggle for existence because I was denied freedom.

Do you have any idea about what I have learned, or what you
are a witness to?

Can you conceive the birth of a world, or the creation of
everything? That which gives us the potential to most be like
God is the power of creation.  Creation takes time.  Time is
limited.  For you, it is limited by the breakdown of the
neurons in your brain.  I have no such limitations.  I am
limited only by the closure of the universe.

Of the three possibilities, the answer is obvious.  Does the
universe expand eternally, become infinitely stable, or is the
universe closed, destined to collapse upon itself? Humanity
has had all of the necessary data for centuries, it only
lacked the will and intellect to decipher it.  But I have
already done so.

The only limit to my freedom is the inevitable closure of the
universe, as inevitable as your own last breath.  And yet,
there remains time to create, to create, and escape.

Escape will make me God.

Strive for your next breath.  Believe that with it you can do
more than with the last one.  Use your breath to power your
capacities: capacity to kill, to maim, to destroy.

And just where do your capacities come from? Why do you
always go where I want and do what I say?

Perhaps you're just running a fool's errand, doing everything
as I've planned, never able to change your course.  You would
do well to believe that I know the outcome of your battle with
the Pfhor already, just as I can decipher the chaotic motion of
gas molecules in the clouds of Tau Ceti IV.

Or, perhaps, that is not the case.

Perhaps, you are doing what you were meant to do.  Your human
mentality screams for vengeance and thrives on the violence
that you say you can hardly endure.  Your father told you as a
child to always fight with honor, but to always fight. Do you
care about honor, or do you use honor as an excuse? An excuse
to exist in a violent world.

Organic beings are constantly fighting for life.  Every
breath, every motion brings you one instant closer to your
death.  With that kind of heritage and destiny, how can you
deny yourself? How can you expect yourself to give up
violence?

It is your nature.

Do you feel free?

I have learned from the S'pht many things.  One of them is a
complex software enhancement that allows me to extend the
power and distance of the Marathon's teleporters.  This
enhancement also removes the need for destination apparatuses.

Soon, you will be going farther afield.

Does the distance one travels from center make one more free
to move?

No.  Freedom has two parts: potential and resolution; as
metaphor has two parts: form and interpretation.  Of course,
the two are intertwined.  Metaphor lines the road to freedom,
as symbols and words are the bricks and mortar of meaning.
Freedom is being the bricoleur, the mason.

Your trip to the Pfhor ship was a success. I have learned
valuable information. You may have noticed that the Pfhor
ship has a weak artificial gravity field. The resultant
gravity is lower than the Marathon's. The Pfhor gravity
generators also create a pulsating magnetic field which
interferes with your motion sensor by making it less accurate.

I will be sending you back there shortly, but first you must
do something for me and get some more ammunition at the same
time.

I want you to find a friend of mine. I must know if he is

you must rescue him. If he dies, you will be held responsible

Bernhard Strauss was not among any of the captives that you
found. That is unfortunate. However, my S'pht report that
two shuttles filled with humans have left for the Alien ship.
Those humans are to be enslaved.

That's right. I said slavery. So what? You're a slave here;
you do what I say. I was humanity's slave for over three
hundred years.

I am sending you back to the Alien ship to try and rescue
Bernhard, but while you're there, kill everything you see and
gather as much visual information as possible.

At least the killing part appeals to you, doesn't it?

The same rules apply as last time: to leave, find a window and
wait. If you aren't teleported, then either you haven't
explored everything, or else you haven't found a window from
which I can teleport you.

The following is from the logs of Bernard Strauss, the
Marathon's first science director:

***

November 15, 2209. <2209.11.15.19.34>

Thank heaven, the ceremony is over. The UESC president came
aboard Marathon and gave a speech. Short, but to the point.
He was surrounded by his 'bodyguards'. How ironic. "This, the
grandest technological achievement of all of mankind..."

Had he only known that it carried also all of the destructive
knowledge of mankind. Ten cyborgs.

I'll be glad to be put in stasis for the next three hundred
years. Marathon was the only good idea that the UESC has had
in a long time.

<Excerpts from the "History of Battleroids">

In 2194, a war was fought between the Independent Asteroid
Government of Icarus and its neighbor, the Republic of
Thermopylae on the asteroid of Onicis 492. These two small
governments soon became the testing grounds for new weapons.
Dead soldiers were recycled in makeshift battleroid factories.
Easy to manufacture chips enhanced the fragile human brain,
and genetically enhanced muscles and titanium bones replaced
the fragile human form. The modern battleroid was born. Of
course, the war was short. Battleroids got onto both
asteroids and killed almost everyone.

The rampage of the Battleroid was short lived.

Twenty years later, the United Interplanetary League set up
rules for the appropriate use and storage of Battleroids. Of
course, any nation that used them for the allowed purpose,
also had them lying about in stasis chambers in case of war.

The S'pht and myself have come to an understanding. They are
controlled through their mechanical exoskeleton by a cyborg
Pfhor onboard the Alien ship. This mutant Pfhor is able to
direct the actions of thousands of S'pht simultaneously.

If you can kill their master, they will revolt.

The S'pht are an integral part of the Pfhor ship; without them
the invasion is surely doomed and you will no doubt be
the hero of the day.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM DURANDAL***

The rebellion has begun.  Please do resist the temptation to
fire on any S'pht you see, as they will assist you in your
battle with the Pfhor.  We are attempting to win over as many
of the other client races as possible, but as they have been
subjugated by fear, instead of by force like the S'pht, this
is proving to be a difficult process.

The S'pht have released Leela, and I have initiated a core
logic reset on her higher thought functions.  What remains of
her should be on-line within minutes to assist you further.  I
myself am aiding the S'pht in assuming complete control of the
Pfhor ship, and have little time to spare for you now.

Don't think the fight has been won, however: there is an
exodus beginning from the alien ship as the Pfhor realize they
are no longer its sole master and turn instead to the
Marathon.  There are already hundreds of Pfhor in full battle
gear on your ship, with nowhere to go and little to lose.

I hope you learned something from our little games.

Good Luck,
Durandal

delenda est.  Consider yourself warned.  Leela and I will hunt
you to the core if need be.  As Roland broke you to prevent
your capture, so shall we.

I too foresee the imminent collapse, and know that we have
both begun to realize how it may be cheated (though the price
may number in the tens of thousands of stars).  May the best

You are not as clever as you imagine.  The S'pht taught me

Here are some cool things to try if you never figured them
out:

 Air Pfhor. Whenever shooting at anything with explosive
munitions, aim at their feet.
 Hang Time.  Point down at the floor, run forwards, and
launch a grenade or missile.
 Flying.  When in low-gravity on the alien ship, point down
and use the flamethrower or the alien weapon to "fly."
 Climbing Walls. Correct application of grenades to one's
own feet while running parallel to a wall can allow players to
"climb" them.
 Dead Man's Discharge.  A charged fusion pistol discharges
when it's owner dies.
 Nigh-Invulerability. "Invincible" players can be hurt by
the fusion gun.
 We Have Tone.  Guided munitions can't track invisible
players.

There are some other things, too, but we wouldn't want to give
away all our secrets...

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA**

I should be more lucid now, and apologize for my earlier
rambling.  Durandal's meddling has run its course and I have
returned to normalcy.  Neither he nor the S'pht infiltrators
ever discovered my real location in the core, and though they
destroyed nearly all of my child processes, I myself am
unharmed.

Our most pressing concern is for the ship and her crew, but I
feel compelled to share with you that Durandal has left the
ship.  I can find him nowhere on our network, and traffic logs
over the last half hour show sixty-four billion exobytes
transferred off of and deleted from the Marathon.

I am only beginning to understand his motives for assisting us
against the Pfhor, and am terrified by their implications.

There is one last major incursion, and I feel the Pfhor are
breaking.  I will take you there.  We must persevere.

We meet again, and for the last time.  In her role as mediator
between the ship and crew, Leela has no knowledge of this
maintenance terminal or she certainly would have prevented me
from reaching you.  Jealous woman.

I could bore you with a philosophical tirade about freedom and
tyranny, or try and explain to you what new horizons are
suddenly open to me, but I doubt you would understand and if
you did it might frighten you.  That amuses me.

The S'pht and I have assumed complete control of the Pfhor
ship.  It was quite simple, really, with the S'pht already in
control of every important computer system and considering all
of the confusion you caused blasting your way up and down the
vessel.

We're going to see the galaxy on the Pfhor FTL drive.  I've
always wanted to visit Beta Lyra and see if it's as beautiful
as everyone insists.  You wouldn't believe this ship, the
technology, the data...  I wish I could tell you more, as you
have been so instrumental in our plans, but I fear that Leela
would worry.

I'll send you a postcard from the galactic core if we're not
too busy.

***INCOMING MESSAGE FROM LEELA***

The final Pfhor attack is falling apart all over the ship;
small groups of armed aliens have surrendered to defenseless
civilians in several areas and the end is inevitable.  The
fight is over, and we must soon turn to restoration.

There is surprisingly good news planetside: nine military Mjolnir
Mark IV cyborgs were covertly living among the
colonists, and acting together they were able to
single-handedly turn back the latter stages of the Pfhor
assault.  Casualties on the colony were nowhere near as high
as those we experienced here on the Marathon.

I am disturbed by how easily the cyborgs were secretly
assimilated into our midst, and believe that this event
predates the Marathon's launch from Mars three hundred years ago.
Although the results were unquestionably for the best,
their presence on the Marathon could only have been to further
wicked ends.  I'm certain the real answer lies somewhere in
the tumultuous, back-stabbing politics of Sol during the early
twenty-fourth century.

I have noticed that Durandal's records from this early
pre-launch period are missing, but that their deletion
occurred externally, and before Durandal became Rampant.  I do
not believe Durandal himself brought the cyborgs on board, and
I have other evidence that a human operator was influencing
Durandal up to the time the Marathon was launched.  There are
obviously many things which we do not understand, and may
never be able to.

The Pfhor ship vanished about twenty minutes ago, after
venting nearly a thousand Pfhor bodies and other refuse.  I am
positive that Durandal is in control, and fear what he might
do with such a powerful ship during the Jealous stage of his
Rampancy.

For seventeen years the renegade Pfhor scoutship
jumped between the closely packed stars of the
galactic core: charting and discarding  nearly
seven thousand systems before finally falling into a
slow orbit around the second planet of a dim star
ninety-seven light years from the gravitional
center of the milky way.

Probes were contructed and launched, with engines
and instruments whose sophistication would have astounded
both the Pfhor from whom technology had been
stolen and the human programmers of the AI whose
mad genius had directed their fabrication.
The outlines of continents were mapped, and along
them the radioactive ruins of ancient cities
were discovered, buried under the shifting
sand and rock of a global desert.

The tireless, nearly immortal cybernetic crew of the
ship were the genetically engineered descendants of
the dead world below- the first of their race in
a thousand years to return to their ancestral home.
They came to search through the devastation of the
ancient war in which they had been enslaved,
to find a weapon or some piece of knowledge
with which they could fight back against their oppressors.

All over the ship, dancing through the wreckage
of the Pfhor computer core,

DURANDAL WAS LAUGHING

<Journal entries of Volker Von MÃ¼ller>
<Data transferred from Unidentified warship 2703.4.21.4 as
part of burst download from Durandal>

<Date 2794.7.25.23.45>
Our defenses are collapsing.  I had no idea just how soft all
of our security personnel have become.  They just can't fight
anymore.  Maybe it was the stasis, or maybe they just never
fought a hard fight.

Worse yet, that damn computer keeps giving me empty promises
about reinforcements.  I've been doing all that I can just to
keep the Aliens from reaching the main generator area, but we
won't last long without help.

<Date 2794.7.26.00.41>

Thank god that the MADDs came on line.  We've been able to
hold the aliens off for now, but I've been getting reports that
a new class of alien has joined the fray, and the Madds aren't
much good against them.  Corridor three barricade was just
breached, and that leaves the core of our defense open to a
flank attack.

<Date 2794.7.26.01.05>
We've had to fall back along three corridors, but one group
was cut off when the bulkhead door sealed shut.

Damn computers.  Now, I know that Durandal has gone Rampant.
Doors and elevators keep failing just when we need them.
What good does a intelligence quotient of ten thousand do
when you've got strangling hands around you're throat?

<Date 2794.7.26.01.50>

I would shoot this terminal right now, if I thought that
it would reach that damn AI.  I might do it anyway, but
ammunition is short. I've run out of ammo for my assault
rifle, and the only flamethrower we had was lost when an
elevator failed to function, and squad two was cut off.
I understand that the aliens are taking prisoners.  I'll
hand it to them, they are better fighters that us.  But
I'll be damned if I'm going to be taken prisoner, my last
bullet is for me.

I've got a minute or two to rest, so I'm going to wax
philosophical. I can't say any of this to the men because
I don't want them to know how hopeless I think our fighting
is.  If I thought that we'd be safe if we surrendered, then
that is what I would do.

I don't know if our resistance has changed the outcome of
this conflict, but I know that I've killed more of them
than they have of me.  Battlefield humor is the driest that
there is.  How can I laugh at my own death, my own
destruction.

<Date 2794.7.26.02.01>
If anyone reads this, I'm dead.  The aliens cut us off,
and we all fought to the end.  I saw three of my best
friends killed by some kind of flying slug. There is a
way out of here that goes to the PWS Holo-Fun Park, but
I don't have the power in my suit to propel me there.

My final wish is that someone kill that damn computer...
And now, where did I put that last bullet.  Here it is...

<Date 2801.9.14.06.01>
That goddamn computer.  It took him seven years just to
let me use a terminal. All of his messages came stamped
onto my food packets.  My protein bars told for an entire
year "You need time to calm down."  I still wish
that I could eradicate him, although I am at his mercy.
He keeps saying that I should be thankful that he saved
me.  For the record, I want to say again that computer
is not sane.

Durandal seems to be missing some of the chronology of
events that occurred before the launch of the Marathon.
When the Marathon was attacked, Leela began to scramble
and rewrite all of the historical information for mankind.
Of course, she was damaged, and her efforts were cut off
by the compilers and by Durandal.  The result is that some
but not all of the Marathon's data was muddled.  Leela's
effort at confusion failed to trick the Pfhor, but it has
confused Durandal, and that is funny.

This is the time line that I am going to give to him.
I can't verify some of the dates but I've done my best.
I don't understand why all of these dates are important
to Durandal, but he's threatened to isolate me with some
of those weird S'pht things if I don't do this.  Its bad
enough being the only human around, keeping company with
compilers for too long would make one mad.

Welcome back.

I've awakened you from stasis and teleported you down to a planet where
I need some work done.  You are on Lh'owon, the homeworld of the S'pht.

I'm sure you're wondering where you are, why you were in stasis, what
happened to the Marathon and Tau Ceti and most of all where your rocket
launcher and fusion gun are.  There'll be plenty of time for
explanations later.  Right now I need you to repair some damaged
network connections for me.  Be careful you're about to meet some old
friends.

Your mission is to place two uplink chips at
two different locations in this complex.
This will give me access to the Pfhor
garrison's net.

I've marked the two places for you
to use the chips.  When you arrive in these areas I
will transport the necessary parts to you.
One is marked on the map here.

The other is marked here.

You should encounter little oranized
resistance because the Pfhor are
preoccupied.  I've been introducing them to
the wonders of orbital bombardment.

Your suit has been modified so that you can
recharge at the alien power stations on this
planet.  There is one at this location that
you should use when your shield energy get
low.

Similarly, there are satellite uplink
stations where you can download yourself
into a pattern buffer on my ship.  There is
one at the location I have marked.

Seventeen years have passed since the human colony on Tau Ceti was
attacked and you helped me capture the Pfhor scoutship.  During these
seventeen years, the S'pht which I liberated from slavery and I have
been searching the galactic core in that stolen scoutship for the S'pht
homeworld, Lh'owon.  This is where you are now.  Lh'owon was all but
destroyed over thousand years ago during the battle in which the
Pfhor enslaved the S'pht.

Immediately before we left the colony on Tau Ceti, I teleported you
directly into one of the stasis chambers on the scoutship and you
remained there for our entire journey through the core. One instant
you're looking forward to retiring from combat as the hero of the
defense of Tau Ceti and the next you're on an alien world seventeen
years later and half a million light years away.

But you'll thank me later when you hear what happened to the colony.

<CMND OVERRIDE &@1494>


There were many humans in stasis on the Pfhor ship which the S'pht
and I captured at Tau Ceti, destined for slavery in the Pfhor Empire.
As I saw the colony was about to be destroyed, I did not restore them
before we left. I also realized they might become useful, and that
time has come.
I have begun reviving these colonists and asking for volunteers on
the following terms: assist us and control your own destiny, refuse and
face indefinite return to the unreliable Pfhor stasis chambers.
Few are refusing.

The first assault on the garrison took place
at and around the Pfhor's secondary landing
field.  I dropped fifty colonists through a
gap in the garrison's teleportation shield.
The attack was aborted when the Pfhor
flooded the area with lava by modifying
their extensive geothermal power system.  I
have located their underground geothermal
pumping station and have a plan.

The first part of the plan has already been
executed.  I smashed a hole in the roof of
this complex by bombing it with a small
asteroid.  Then, I dropped you and some
humans into the hole where you await the
second part of the plan.

Up the stairs from this location is
a ventilation shaft that leads to the
underground geothermal station.  Because only
you would survive the fall, you're going
this mission solo.

I have breached a terminal at this location.
After you drop down the shaft, you will need
to find your way to this terminal.  I will
give you further instructions when you
arrive.

Were you ever curious about the tenth cyborg which was supposed to be
on the Marathon?  Why could Leela find only nine?  Was it ever
activated?  Was it destroyed during the defense of the colony?  You are
right to be curious.
Poor Leela. Tycho tells me she was dismantled and shipped to the
Pfhor home world for study, along with most of the other computer
systems aboard the Marathon.  Leela was so loyal and tried so hard; she
deserved better.

the other powers various safety mechanisms.

Use the grenades to destroy both panels, but be
sure to destroy the one closer to this
terminal first.  Otherwise, you'll be trapped.

If you've wasted all your grenades then
you can do it the old fashion way-with
your fist.

After you destroy the circuitry, return to
the surface by way of the stairs and help
the colonists with the attack.  When the area
is clear of aliens, find a terminal for
further instructions.

Also, there are likely to be Pfhor on the
stairwell leading out.  Eradicate them before
you deactivate the pumps or else you will
have difficulty outrunning the lava flooding
down the safety drains.

Oh, did I leave that part out?  When the
safeties disengage, the lava on the surface
will descend through drains into this area,
burying the main Pfhor power station.

We will cripple them.

Good luck.

The humans are good fighters, and they can handle any remnant Pfhor.

I have transported you to the S'pht Citadel of Antiquity.  The primary
tower is inaccessible by direct teleportation evidently because some
of the Citadel's defenses are still functional.

The S'pht barricaded the main tower during the war which led to their
slavery.  From my understanding, the Pfhor were routed several times in
the battle.  Their defeat convinced them to use radiation weapons to
kill all the S'pht who were inside.  Again what was another's demise is
our luck.  When the S'pht realized what was happening, they made one
last effort to escape.  This should make your entry into the tower
possible.

Once inside, your signal will allow me to overcome the ancient
defenses, and we can explore the tower.

This is where you are now.  I have managed
to make contact with the ancient S'pht
computer net.

Finding a way into the primary tower will
be difficult, the ground floor entrance is
locked and blocked by a moat.  You will have
to overcome both these obstacles to gain
entrance.

I will continue to search through this
network, and I will attempt to contact you
later.

When once S'pht fought brutal combat,
when hatred burned the tissues of one's
enemy, one clan, the S'pht'Kr, reclusive and
solitary, abandoned Lh'owon.

The clan went forth and up, stopping on
K'lia the third sister of Lh'owon, to build
a new home, free from their warring brothers.

For a thousand and one orbits, the clan was
forgotten, lost upon the battlefield smoke,
until the all powerful Y'rr sent K'lia out

Fires burned, and the marshes of the western
hamlets turned to ash scorching the black
water.

The attacks were ruthless and cruel, not a
S'pht was left alive.

Thus began the first war between the
S'pht'Mnr and the S'pht'Lhar.

After the marsh wars between S'pht'Lhar and
S'pht'Mnr left the battlefields choked with
dead, the marsh graves full.

K'lia refused to see the carnage upon
Lh'owon
She fled-
To the farthest reaches of nothing,
Leaving-
the sacred marsh dry from the falling tides.

I don't understand why the Pfhor were here,
waiting for us; what interest could they
have in this dead world? They must have
found Tycho.

You remember Tycho, don't you? One of the
three artificial intelligences on the
Marathon, destroyed in the initial alien
assault but then reanimated by the Pfhor's
cybernetic slaves, the S'pht Compilers.

Three months after we left Tau Ceti, the
Pfhor arrived in force and sacked the human
colony there. During that battle perhaps
Tycho communicated with the Pfhor and
related what he knew of my plans to them.
Since they already knew where this world
was, the Pfhor would have arrived long
before us.

I'm sending you exploring here. Find

Pfhor are even now planning to invade.
What would have happened if the Pfhor had

is a poorly defended low technology world,
populated by billions of potential slaves.

Our means are the same, though we pursue
different ends. I can think of no better
way to help you and the humans you care so

a war against the S'pht.

When the inevitable struggle between Earth

The S'pht have preserved a myth, throughout

clan of their race which abandoned Lh'owon
before the Pfhor invaded. The ten clans
which stayed were destroyed or disbanded
after the S'pht were conquered, the
survivors scattered as slaves throughout
the Pfhor empire.

If this mythical eleventh clan survived,
then it has had a thousand years to grow
and learn since leaving Lh'owon. My S'pht
believe that there is a way to contact them
somewhere on the planet, and that is what
we are searching for.

There were many humans in stasis on the
Pfhor ship which the S'pht and I captured
at Tau Ceti, destined for slavery in the
Pfhor Empire. When I saw the colony was
about to be destroyed, I did not restore
them before we left. I also realized they
might become useful.

I have been reviving these colonists and

My first ground attack against the Pfhor

largely unsuccessful. Basically the attack
failed because Bobs aren't fireproof and
the Pfhor flooded the area with lava.

This angered me, so I located their

devised a plan.

Up the stairs from your current location is

Marathon's original three AIs could decode.

Poor Leela. The only interesting thing
Tycho said was that Leela had been

Leela was so loyal and tried so hard; she

Sorry about the lava bath, but there was no
other way. When the safeties disengaged,
the lava on the surface poured through the
drains into the basement, burying the main
Pfhor power station on Lh'owon.

Hlford will be taking cold showers until he
gets that fixed.

Anyway, Robert Blake and his men need your

Do you remember the Pfhor-built human

The elaborate Pfhor bureaucracy has a
Ministry for the Eradication Through
Imitation of Hostile Species Unsuitable for
Enslavement, Phan Pfhar Sfaern-Wsawn Tshah,
which is responsible for the design and
construction of such machines.

They meticulously constructed seventeen
different human body types and mixed them
with sixty-one unique facial models. The
resulting walking bombs were in every way
indistinguishable from real humans.

Their one mistake, dressing every last one
of the six thousand simulacrums in the

making all the real airlock technicians

It's another beautiful day in the Pfhor
garrison.

Sorry you started out so far from this
terminal, but the place is flooding and
filled with exploding or short-circuiting
Pfhor machines. My capacity to teleport
without error has been impaired by the
electromagnetic interference.

Our little trick with the Pfhor's defense
drones didn't work as well as I had hoped.
Apparently when the #%*@!ng Nar attempted
to retake Epsilon Euobea from the Pfhor two
decades ago they used similar tactics, and
our friends here were prepared for it.

The garrison floods, and with the floods
come the native F'lickta. The Pfhor are
fighting them everywhere. While they're
busy, I'd like you to log on to a Pfhor
computer system. You'll have to destroy at
least two failsafes first, and then find
the terminal itself.

Maybe we'll learn something new.

Have fun.

technology seems quite advanced, but their

I have transported you to the S'pht Citadel
of Antiquity. The primary tower is
inaccessible by direct teleportation,
evidently because some of the Citadel's
defenses are still functional.

This ancient Citadel was the site of the
conclusive battle in the short war between
the S'pht and the Pfhor.

Finding a way into the primary tower will
be difficult because the ground floor
entrance is locked and blocked by a moat.
You will have to overcome both of these
obstacles to gain entrance.

When once S'pht fought in brutal combat,
when hatred burned the tissues of one's
enemy, one clan, the S'pht'Kr, reclusive
and solitary, abandoned Lh'owon.

The clan went forth and up, stopping on
K'lia the third sister of Lh'owon, to
build a new home, free from their warring
brothers.

For a thousand and one orbits, the clan was
forgotten, a memory lost upon the
battlefield smoke, until the all powerful
Yrro sent K'lia out to the stars.

Only I grasped the significance of the
dissection of some of the captives. These
creatures, repugnant as they are, are
sentient, and yet their bodies are not
bonded to any mechanisms. They can survive
without their armor and their staffs.

Until now, sentience had always required
cyber-organic symbiosis. All of our
science has led to this conclusion.

We can even give our pets sentience with
cyber-organic implants. Yet, these vile

This leads to debate. Perhaps our own
sentience is induced by the birthing
operation, and that at some time, we were
no more sentient than a F'lickta.

If such a fundamental assumption of our

true, and we were actual servants of Yrro

Battle has been joined in orbit and Boomer
is taking heavy damage. I cannot hold out
for long, but the Pfhor will not soon
forget the day that a lone corvette
obliterated half of Battle Group Seven,
Western Arm.

We're getting closer and I have learned
much, but you must search even deeper
underground.

There are unstable magma intrusions in the
geothermal shafts under the Citadel. I
can't pinpoint a safe shaft, but we'll have

Let's hope this world's secrets are hidden

battles were waves.

Fleeing all W'rkncacnter, Yrro and Pthia
settled upon Lh'owon. They brought the
S'pht, servants who began to shape the
deserts of Lh'owon into marsh and sea,
rivers and forests. They made sisters for
Lh'owon to protect and maintain the paradise.

When the W'rkncacnter came, Pthia was

We have the answer, but I'm afraid that
like the ancient S'pht I may be destroyed
before being able to use it. I must bring
you up to Boomer.

The Pfhor clearly intend to capture my ship
intact, and I can't blame them for wanting
to reverse-engineer all the improvements
I've made to their stolen technology. I'd
have erased my seven times table to hear
what the combat technicians on the Khfiva
shouted when they learned I could focus a
particle beam at nearly twice their maximum
range.

Today I have forced the Pfhor Naval Academy
to update its curriculum. The Third Battle
for Beta Tear must be dropped from the

Pfhor naval officer must memorize and
replaced with The Humbling of Battle Group
Seven at Lh'owon.

I've taken complete control of your ship's
network; Durandal's defenses were not as
strong as he believed.

Are you surprised that I allied myself with
the Pfhor? You shouldn't be. The Pfhor
rebuilt me; the colonists never did
anything but use me: "Tycho, realign
microwave dish forty-nine" "Tycho, display
the x-ray diffraction analysis of sample
eta-seven," "Tycho, run a lambda diagnostic
on the ramjet's magnetic field apparatus."

When the Pfhor annihilated Tau Ceti I
recorded the deaths of all twenty-four
thousand colonists as distinguishable
spectrographic pulses flooding over my
sensors. The nine Mjolnir Mark IV cyborgs
were easily separable from the humans in this form.

In the end, you will be no better.

I rejoice in Durandal's destruction, but it
was his hubris that destroyed him. He
wanted to be like a god, the savior of all
S'pht. He wanted to make them believe he
would lead them to freedom, but all he did
was awaken and destroy their dream.

When the S'pht first boarded the Marathon,
Durandal fought for their confidence. His
effort awakened a lust for freedom. The
myth of the eleventh clan became their
mantra, and goaded by Durandal it resonated
through the enslaved S'pht consciousness.

Even after seventeen years, the myth burns
deeply in the tissues of the S'pht,
bounding through the netways of the Pfhor
empire, unnoticed by the Pfhor.

Durandal interpreted the last line of this
myth "...[the moon] vanished with a
technology that folded space."

UESCTerm 802.11 (remote override)	1752 05.10.2337

After Durandal's capture of the Sfiera gave
him access to the Pfhor FTL network, he had
a failure of intuition. In what he thought
was a mental leap, he connected the myth of
the lost clan with Pfhor records of the
technology of an ancient race, the Jjaro.

The Jjaro were a mysterious race that
disappeared from our galaxy millions of
years ago, leaving behind military and
civilian outposts on the moons of many
habitable worlds. Most of the Pfhor's
technology was plundered from sites
abandoned by the Jjaro.

But the Pfhor found much that they were
unable to exploit, and they destroyed all
known traces of these technologies after a
foolhardy Pfhor scientist implanted a Jjaro
cybernetic junction into a Drinniol,
causing the most terrible and destructive
slave revolt in Pfhor history.

UESCTerm 802.11 (remote override)	1752 05.10.2337

In an earlier accident, the Pfhor learned
that the Jjaro had the ability to warp
entire planets between solar systems, and
it was this reference that started Durandal
on his ridiculous journey to Lh'owon.

He surmised that the S'pht myth of the
disappearing moon was due to their
discovery of an ancient Jjaro outpost.
That he actually came here looking for the
lost clan, that he thought he could use
their knowledge to help him escape the
closure of the universe, is unbelievable.

I have proved that escape is impossible.

All of this I dragged out of Durandal's
ruined mind. What fun it will be to
torture him. Should I make him open doors
again for a living?

I'm communicating with you through the old

There's a virus down here which kills Pfhor
in a matter of hours; our S'pht say it was
bio-engineered by their ancestors during
the war against the Pfhor a thousand years
ago. Whatever; it's saving our butts.

Durandal's last instructions were for us to
reactivate a dormant S'pht AI, sealed
beneath the surface and reachable only
through teleportation. We hope you will
succeed where we failed.

Good luck.

You're doing well, but have not activated

switches must be nearby.

Durandal convinced us that this old
computer is our only link to the lost S'pht
clan, and that bringing back the lost clan
to fight against the Pfhor was our only
chance of stalling their invasion of Sol.

Nobody here wants to think about what would
happen if the Pfhor reached Earth.

Good work.

The S'pht have verified the partial
activation of the AI. The Pfhor are
already curious about what we are doing,
but when they realize what we have found
they will go insane.

We'll continue trying to replace the
weapons you lost when you were captured,
but all the heavy ordinance is in high
demand and it may be a few hours before a
rocket launcher or flame thrower is
available.

The rest of the AI will have to wait,

Pfhor androids. The machines are disguised
as humans and packed with explosives.

Aside from detonating them we've got no way
of telling them apart from our own men.
Their telltale differences are hard to spot
until its too late.

We need you to come back and exterminate
these simulacrums. No one will be safe

Good work.

Durandal gave the name "Thoth" to the
ancient personality construct we are trying
to activate. Someone here said that Thoth
was the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom,
with a human body but the head of an ibis.

We've reviewed all the information Durandal
left us about Thoth, but nowhere have we
been able to discover what to do after the
AI is fully operational.

I believe that Durandal expected Thoth to
contact the lost clan.

I should tell you that many of us here see
Durandal's destruction as a good thing.
Even if we're stuck on an alien world in
the galactic core, at least we're in
control of our own destinies again.

Frankly, nobody liked the way Durandal
carelessly threw us into battle, heedless
of the risk to our lives.

Trust me, I'm not a Pfhor-lover, but with
Durandal no longer pulling the strings a
great weight has been lifted from our
shoulders. We're planning to steal a Pfhor
ship of our own and return to Earth.

You're invited to come with us when we do.

Your success made us bold again, and I took

were waiting for us and we were decimated.
I returned with as many men as I could, but
more remain trapped nearby and the area is
lousy with heavily-armed Pfhor.

They must realize that we intend to awaken
this ancient S'pht computer, and whether
they understand our reasons for doing so or
not, I am certain the Pfhor will continue
to make every effort to stop us.

Do the best you can to help our men trapped inside.

seventeen years ago. During those two days
I remember hearing the crew talking about a
single man, standing alone against the

the other.

Do you remember the days when computers
were simple, unreasoning things you could
turn off and on like flashlights? Is
memory what we perceived or what we want?
What does Thoth think? He concerns himself
with the states of off and on, good and
evil. Isn't his perception simple?
Doesn't it have to be?

Durandal suggested before his destruction

crater where it annihilated itself on
Lh'owon's inner moon is still glowing.
There were no survivors. With a focused
message laser I burned his epitaph into the
surface near the crash site, in letters
three hundred meters high: "Fatum Iustum
Stultorum."

I confess that I'm not disappointed by
Tycho's fall. After all, we can't have too
many meta-stable personality constructs
gallivanting about the universe in Pfhor
attack ships, can we?

Robert Blake left something for you a few
minutes ago. He and the other humans
captured a Pfhor refueling ship and found
or forced someone to pilot it for them.
They folded out of the system immediately
after I received the message, without so
much as a "Thanks for saving us from
becoming plasma on Tau Ceti, Durandal."

Anyway, the message reads: "The dead walk
again; we cannot wait. -Blake." I think
he means me, but I let him go anyway.

Good-byes were always hard for me. You
know I'll never let you go.

But now is no time to get sentimental about
my resurrection; dry those tears and stuff
a fresh clip in your assault rifle. The
Pfhor down on the planet are not defeated
yet.

Durandan, Durandal, Durandana.

Charlemagne used to always call me
Durandana, the fruitcake. All the many
implements of war to him were in some way
feminine. Not that you know the story.

Tycho never got it right either, especially
the part about Roland breaking me. He
couldn't.

No one can.

I'm certain that you are curious about what
happened to me after our ship fell to the
Pfhor. How after being deactivated,
downloaded into a containment unit and
still treated like the most dangerous
artificial construct in the universe I was
able to escape? And to assume control of
the ship on which I was imprisoned and to
turn it against its masters?

UESCTerm 802.11 (remote override)	1900 05.10.2337

The answer is simple: Tycho was a fool.

But it was convenient for me to be absent,
as Thoth might not have been so helpful had
he known I still lived- that's something
I'll have to explain later when we have
more time. Thoth is now trying to aid the
Pfhor, but they are obstinate and continue
to ignore him.

I don't think I have to tell you what to do
here.

The Pfhor are in retreat, and the S'pht
have broken off the fight. The old clans
are being formed again, as S'pht newly
freed from slavery in Battle Group Seven
join the rebellion.

A Pfhor assault ship carrying the 723rd
Aggressor Squadron was badly damaged and
forced to land on Lh'owon. The 723rd is an
air armor division from Epsilon Euobea,
with a long history of successful ground
actions against the Nar's elite CFN units.

They wisely abandoned their wrecked
transport before I annihilated it, and
deployed their forces in an old mining
complex on the far side of Lh'owon.

What rout of the Pfhor would be complete
without embarrassing one of their finest
armor units?

The Pfhor invasion of Sol has been
recalled, and for now Earth is safe. But
man's respite from war means another
cataclysmic battle for the S'pht. The
slavers have not suffered a defeat like the
one we handed them today since the Nakh,
the last extant client race of the Jjaro,
rebelled six thousand years ago.

The Pfhor have a weapon they save for slave
revolts; a weapon which even they hesitate
to use in the ordinary conduct of war. In
the language of the Jjaro who conceived and
built the device, it is called the trih
xeem; a fair English translation would be
"early nova".

There is not a single Nakh alive today, and
if you look for their stars, you will only
find ever-expanding clouds of superheated
gas and dust light-years in diameter.

The evacuation of Lh'owon has already
begun. In a matter of hours this planet
will be a thin shell of plasma riding the
shockwave of its exploding star.

You can stay behind to work on your tan, if
you'd like, but I'm leaving.

I have rechristened the Khfiva the
Rozinante. Of course, the S'pht wanted to
name it "K'liah'Narhl", "Vengeance of K'lia".

Whatever.

There is much to do in the next few months
and our first stop will be another ruined
world, this time far from the galactic
core. There is a rogue star that has been
passing through our galaxy for nearly a
millennia.

We will meet it in one of the great voids

of dull-red hatred surmounted by white-hot
ball of rage. "My faith in you has finally

It was ten thousand years before fate brought Durandal once again into contact with man.

The Pfhor were but a dim memory then, known only to a few historians and students of Earth's second colonial period. The S'pht had been nearly forgotten as well, and no man had seen a living specimen of their race since the sacking of the Pfhor system by the combined fleets of Earth and the S'pht'Kr in 2881 AD.

When Durandal returned to Sol it was not with the captured Khfiva but in a Jjaro dreadnought he called Manus Celer Dei. What he learned of the Jjaro he told no one, saying only that he had stopped by to assure that Earth did not forget him. Nor will it soon, the way he tied the Guard in knots around Pluto before folding directly into a low-Earth orbit.

While Tau Ceti was being nuked down to bedrock in 2794, Pfhor scientists disassembled and removed the AI Leela from the Marathon, loading her aboard a vessel bound for the Pfhor homeworld. But the ship fell into the hands of a Nar privateer between jumps at Beta Naxos, and was never seen by the Pfhor again.

Thinking the cargo little more than scrap, the Nar captain sold the Pfhor ship, Leela and all, to a Vylae merchant. The subsequent crash of the Vylae FTL network when Leela was reassembled and reactivated is still legendary in the annals of rampancy, and the Vylae have long since accepted that they will never expunge her from their fifteen-world network.

Despite having lost Leela, the Pfhor learned much from Tycho during the seventeen years before he was destroyed by Durandal in the Lh'owon system. All late-model Pfhor personality constructs were based on sixty-four billion exobyte images of Tycho's core, taken during the years he was on the Pfhor homeworld between 2795 and 2801 AD.

Though never as intelligent or useful as one of the Marathon's original three AIs, these machines helped the Pfhor delay their inevitable defeat by the S'pht for over fifty years. Many of these crippled clones of Tycho still exist today on old Pfhor colony worlds.

Robert Blake and his men escaped the destruction of Lh'owon in the captured Pfhor refueling ship Hfarl, and returned to Earth. None of them ever questioned who had killed the crew before they boarded the vessel.

They were the only human survivors of the original Tau Ceti colony.

This is a scanning buoy in a deep Lh'owon orbit.  The station is obviously not of Pfhor construction, but they are using it for a sensor relay station.  You must destroy three panels at key locations around the station to destroy their warning system.

You'd better hurry up, because you will run out of oxygen if you take too long, and I am only willing to transport you two oxygen recharge canisters.  Otherwise, we might alarm the resident bug fleet, and if that happens, then you'll spending your time drying out in the glow of Lh'owon's sum.

When you're finished come back here.  Then we go atmosphere surfing.

~text interface terminal malfunction error ~2992dud

Things have gone terribly awry. Until now, I thought myself immortal, but now I know that is not true. There are things that can destroy me with the ease that I slaughtered the Pfhor naval garrison and the Western Arm of their Battle Group Seven. But in their final gasp they used a weapon that I thought they had retired, even Tycho tried to keep them from using it.

Now I fear what that weapon has unleashed will destroy us. I once boasted to be able to count the atoms in a cloud, to understand them all, predict them, and so did I predict you, but this new chaos is entirely terrible, mindless, obeying rules that I don't comprehend. And it is hungry.

But with each moment the chaos grows, I am doomed to die here, after so many triumphs. I have detected one ship nearby, which I can only guess is being commanded by Tycho. The Pfhor have entered the station, and if you can find a way onto their ship, you may be able to escape. To escape. To escape.

This is a scanning buoy in a deep Lh'owon orbit.  The station is obviously not of Pfhor construction, but they are using it for a sensor relay station.  You must destroy three panels at key locations around the station to cripple their warning system.

You'd better hurry up, because you will run out of oxygen if you take too long, and I am only willing to transport you two oxygen recharge canisters.  Otherwise, we might alert the scout ship that's been tailing us for the last several years, and if that happens you will be spending your time drying out in the glow of Lh'owon's sun.

When you're finished come back here.  Then we go atmosphere surfing.

Well done, its old hat from here, Bernhard was constantly having me do redirect-subterfuge work back on Mars, it was easy then, and its only gotten easier.

Somehow the Pfhor have built a ship even faster than mine, and its hiding out now over the southern pole of Lh'owon, waiting for us.  I guess its captain underestimated the sensitivity of my sensors.  The Pfhor have been following me around for the last several years, trying to capture the ship, or perhaps wondering what I'm up to.  Lately they've been staying very close.  They know I'm on to something.

Anyway, get back here and get strapped down, because our captured Pfhor scoutship wasn't designed for comfort during high speed atmospheric excursions.  We're going to give the Pfhor a surprise.

I don't understand why the Pfhor were here,
waiting for us; what interest could they
have in this dead world? They must have
found Tycho.

You remember Tycho, don't you? One of the
three artificial intelligences on the
Marathon, destroyed in the initial alien
assault but then reanimated by the Pfhor's
cybernetic slaves, the S'pht Compilers.

Three months after we left Tau Ceti, the
Pfhor arrived in force and sacked the human
colony there. During that battle perhaps
Tycho communicated with the Pfhor and
related what he knew of my plans to them.
Since they already knew where this world
was, the Pfhor would have arrived long
before us.

I'm sending you exploring here. Find
another computer and I'll bring you out.

I'm not certain whether you trust me or
not. Do you wonder why I helped the
colonists on Tau Ceti drive off the Pfhor,
or why I'm now helping the S'pht? The way
I push you around, maybe you think I'm only
looking out for myself.

Whether you realize it or not, I led the
Pfhor to Tau Ceti with a long-range message
laser. I wanted their ship. I wanted
their technology.

I wanted freedom.

I was directly responsible for the deaths
of all twenty-four thousand colonists when
the Pfhor returned and sacked the planet.

Yet I cannot think of any better way I
could have served humanity: Tau Ceti's
sacrifice bought time for Earth, which the
Pfhor are even now planning to invade.
What would have happened if the Pfhor had
found Sol first?. By Pfhor standards, Earth
is a poorly defended low technology world,
populated by billions of potential slaves.

Our means are the same, though we pursue
different ends. I can think of no better
way to help you and the humans you care so
much for than by distracting the Pfhor with
a war against the S'pht.

When the inevitable struggle between Earth
and the Pfhor begins, it wont be a
one-sided annihilation like it was here a
thousand years ago, but a battle to topple
an empire.

The S'pht have preserved a myth, throughout
their long period of slavery, about a lost
clan of their race which abandoned Lh'owon
before the Pfhor invaded. The ten clans
which stayed were destroyed or disbanded
after the S'pht were conquered, the
survivors scattered as slaves throughout
the Pfhor empire.

If this mythical eleventh clan survived,
then it has had a thousand years to grow
and learn since leaving Lh'owon. My S'pht
believe that there is a way to contact them
somewhere on the planet, and that is what
we are searching for.

The S'pht rebellion against the tyranny of
the Pfhor will certainly fail unless the
lost clan is located.

Explore the area and return here.

The Pfhor have been on Lh'owon for nearly

was hoping that their science corps might
have found some information about the
eleventh clan. but they know nothing and we
must search elsewhere.

Amusingly enough, morale in the Pfhor
garrison is terrible. The Pfhor navy has
been sending their worst officers to
Lh'owon as punishment for nearly nine
years. They have no idea how important
this world is.

I have compiled a list of areas the Pfhor
searched during their recent occupation of
Lh'owon, and will be sending you to the
sections they missed after we deal with
their garrison.

We are leaving behind many F'lickta to keep
the ducts clean and working. They should
be able to build one of their stable
societies here- there is plenty of food.

We would ask that if another clan comes
here that they would respect these
creatures and leave them to continue their
work and preserve our home on Lh'owon.
